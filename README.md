# Bullet Deceleration Models 🎯📉

A small simulation project exploring **three mathematical models** for bullet deceleration after impact.  
The goal is to compare how different assumptions affect the velocity decrease over time/distance.

## 📌 Overview
This project implements and compares three deceleration approaches:
- **Constant deceleration**
- **Linear deceleration**
- **Quadratic deceleration**

The output includes plots/analysis to help visualize differences between the models.
